# Project Retrospective

### What Went Well
- **Code Reviews**: We did a good job reviewing code. This made our code much better.
- **Making Decisions**: We were quick to agree on things without arguing at all. 
- **Quick Communication**: We kept in touch well. No one had to wait long for a response from each other.
- **Learning from Each Other**: Each of us actually learned something new from another one in technologies of the project stack.
- **Adaptable Scheduling**: We did well in adapting to times when another team member was busy.
- **No blocking**: We didn't have any delays when one of us had to wait long for another to finish their work.

### Challenges We Faced
#### Ilya:
- **Clarity in Communication**:  Sometimes, my wording wasn't precise. I needed to be clearer.
- **Time Management**: I often underestimated the time required for tasks (e.g., predicting 5 minutes but taking 20).

#### Alexandr:
- **Git**: It would be better to study the branching aspects of git before we started the project. 

**Overall**, we did not encounter any major problem. We complemented each other really well.
### How We Can Improve
- Take into account the problems described above.
